User Agreement
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING USER AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE LEGAL DISCLAIMER, LIABILITY LIMITATIONS AND OTHER PROVISIONS BELOW) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEB SITE OR USING OUR OTHER SERVICES.
This User Agreement is made between you and Shopzilla International ("Shopzilla", "we" or "us"). You can find out more information about Shopzilla International in the "About Shopzilla" section of the Shopzilla Web site ("our Web site"). 
By using the Shopzilla Web site or our other services, you agree to the terms of this User Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this User Agreement, you may not use our Web site or other services.
We reserve the right, at any time, to modify, alter, or update this User Agreement, and you agree to be bound by such modifications, alterations, or updates once they are posted on our Web site.
1. 
Significance of Ratings
"Customer Certified" ratings reflect the aggregated responses of actual customers--typically many thousands of consumers--surveyed at the point-of-sale for each online merchant. As such, these ratings are informative for those wishing to use them, but they do not guarantee any level of performance by an online merchant or other third party in any given transaction.
All other ratings reflect the aggregated responses of hundreds or thousands of actual consumers who are members of our Online Research Panel of actual online buyers. Again, as such, these ratings are informative for those wishing to use them, but they do not guarantee any level of performance by an online merchant or other third party in any given transaction.
Participating merchants and other third parties may pay us to be presented on our site or to have their product or service offerings featured in our search results, and may also purchase research from us, but in no event does any such payment affect the merchant rating given to any merchant by participating online shoppers.
Users agree not to take any actions for the purpose of manipulating or distorting, or that may undermine the integrity and accuracy of, the merchant ratings.
2. 
Consumer Reviews
The consumer reviews on our site are comments received from actual customers--typically many thousands of consumers--surveyed at the point-of-sale for each online merchant, as well as customers who have elected to post a review on our site. As such, these reviews are informative for those wishing to use them, but they do not guarantee any level of performance by an online merchant or other third party in any given transaction.
Participating merchants and other third parties may pay us to be presented on our site or to have their product or service offerings featured in our search results, and may also purchase research from us, but in no event does any such payment affect the reviews given to any merchant by participating online shoppers.
Users agree not to take any actions for the purpose of manipulating or distorting, or that may undermine the integrity and accuracy of, the merchant reviews. Furthermore, users agree not to post any review that is false or that contains profanity, personal attacks upon individuals, ethnic slurs, personal information such as credit card numbers, material that violates another's legal rights, or other offensive or inappropriate content for a general shopping audience. By posting a review, the poster thereby represents that the review is based upon an actual online shopping experience with the merchant being reviewed and irrevocably assigns all copyright and other intellectual property rights in the review to Shopzilla. Shopzilla may publish the review on its Web site or elsewhere in its discretion and reserves the right to remove or alter the content of any review deemed offensive or in violation of its policies, and all decisions by Shopzilla in this regard are final.
3. 
Legal Disclaimer
Shopzilla shall not be held responsible or liable for any actions taken, either wholly or in part, based on the information provided on Shopzilla's Web site, or for any loss, damage, expense or injury resulting from any transactions conducted with any online merchant or other third party listed on Shopzilla's Web site. The information, services, products, and materials contained in this Web site or available through our other services, including, without limitation, all text, graphics, and links, are provided on an "AS IS" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Shopzilla DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO SUCH INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, as well as representations and warranties of title, non-infringement, freedom from computer viruses, worms, and other operating problems, and implied warranties arising from course of dealing or course of performance.
In addition, since Shopzilla cannot verify all information provided by online merchants and other third parties, and errors in gathering or reporting such information may occur due to the large volume of merchants with many different products and services, Shopzilla does not represent or warrant that the information accessible via our Web site or other services is always accurate, complete or current, and shall not be liable for or responsible to honor (or to cause any merchant to honor) any erroneous information regarding the price, description and availability of, or any discounts, offers, promotions and coupons relating to, any product or service offerings available on our Web site or through our other services. Furthermore, due to the dynamic nature of online shopping, all information regarding such matters is subject to change without notice. Shopzilla SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, EXPENSE, OR INJURY YOU MAY SUSTAIN THROUGH YOUR RELIANCE UPON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH SHOPZILLA'S SERVICES OR YOUR USE OF ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, whether or not they were accessed via our Web site or other services.
4. 
Liability Limitations
In no event shall Shopzilla or its affiliates or agents (the "Shopzilla Parties") be liable, whether in an action under contract, negligence, or any other theory, arising out of or in connection with the use, inability to use, or performance of the information, services, products, and materials available from this Web site or through our other services, in an amount greater than the lower of (i) the price of the merchandise or service involved in the transaction or proposed transaction as to which one or more Shopzilla Parties is held to be negligent or otherwise responsible, or (ii) if no such merchandise or service is involved, or if the value thereof would exceed $100, then a maximum liability limitation of $100 in the aggregate. You and we agree that this is a fair allocation of risk based upon the manner and cost by which Shopzilla's services are provided to you, and taking into account your ability to take other measures or consult other resources in connection with purchasing goods and services online. 
FURTHERMORE, IN NO EVENT SHALL SHOPZILLA OR ITS AFFILIATES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
, even if we have been previously advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations shall apply notwithstanding to any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.
5. 
Third-Party Sites
Our Web site, surveys, or other services may include links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by online merchants, survey incentive vendors, and other third parties. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the availability of, or the content located on or through, any third-party site. You should contact the site administrator or Webmaster for those third-party sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or the content located on such sites. Your use of those third-party sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of each site, and we are not responsible therefor.
In certain areas on our site, we may join forces with a reputable third-party source of specialized information and other content so that you can quickly and easily make informed decisions about such products and services. In each of these areas, the Shopzilla header will note that the services are "Powered by" or "By" the third party. This indicates that the content resides on the third party's servers and your use of those services is governed by that company's privacy policies and terms of use, which you can access at the bottom of each page in those areas. We recommend that you always review their privacy policies and terms of use before you complete any transaction with them. This User Agreement (other than our privacy policies) also apply as between you and Shopzilla with respect to your use of those third-party services accessed through our site.
6. 
Dispute Resolution
We will do our best to resolve any problems or issues that you may have with us or our services in a satisfactory manner. If, however, we are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, each of us agrees that any claim or controversy between us, or arising in any way out of the use or operation of our Web site or other services, or any information, services, products, and materials contained in this site or available through our other services, shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in Los Angeles, California, under the rules and procedures of the AAA. Any such dispute or controversy shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitrator shall have authority to resolve all matters in dispute between us (subject to the legal disclaimer and liability limitations set forth above), including the applicability, scope and binding effect of this arbitration agreement, and to award arbitration costs and expenses to the prevailing party as determined by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may pursue preliminary or injunctive remedies in an appropriate state or federal court sitting in Los Angeles, California pending the decision of the arbitrator, without waiving the right or affecting the obligation to arbitrate hereunder.
7. 
Other Terms
Our Web site and other services are operated and provided in the State of California, USA. As such, we are subject to the laws of the State of California, and such laws will govern this User Agreement, without giving effect to any choice of law rules. We make no representation that our Web site or other services are appropriate, legal or available for use in other locations. Accordingly, if you choose to access our site or other services, you agree to do so subject to the internal laws of the State of California. You are in the best position to know whether your use of our site or other services may be prohibited or restricted by local laws in your location, and therefore are responsible for compliance with any such laws. We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to our Web site or other services, and operation of our Web site or other services may be interfered with or adversely affected by numerous factors or circumstances outside of our control. This is the entire agreement and understanding between us regarding the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified as provided above. If any provision of this User Agreement shall be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any reason, the other provisions (and any partially-unenforceable provision) shall not be affected thereby and shall remain valid and enforceable to the maximum permissible extent. You agree that this User Agreement and any other agreements referenced herein may be assigned by Shopzilla, in our sole discretion, to a third party in the event of a merger or acquisition. This User Agreement shall apply in addition to, and shall not be superseded by, any other written agreement between us relating to your participation as a Shopzilla Member or participation in any other program or service offered by Shopzilla. You agree that by accepting this User Agreement, you are consenting to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information and other practices described in our

About BizRate UK
Shopzilla, Inc. Privacy Policy
Shopzilla, Inc. ("Shopzilla") operates online shopping Web sites and provides other services ("Services")
designed to deliver the best possible online shopping experience to you, our users. We are committed to
protecting the privacy and security of the information we may gather about you, and we appreciate your
trust that we will use and share that information carefully and sensibly.
Shopzilla operates the Shopzilla Network, which includes Shopzilla.com, BizRate.com and equivalent domains
in the United Kingdom, Germany and France, and all other Web sites we operate or provide comparison-shopping
content to, email newsletters or other email, surveys, or other media or Services we offer to consumers from
time to time. All information you provide to Shopzilla via the Shopzilla Network, at any of our Web sites or
otherwise in connection with our Services, will be transmitted to, held and processed by us as described in
this Privacy Policy. Shopzilla is a company incorporated in the United States of America. Accordingly,
information submitted by you to Shopzilla will be transmitted to, held and processed in the USA. You should
be aware that the laws governing data protection in the USA are not the same as those of European or other
countries.
This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning your privacy. Although this Privacy Policy may seem
long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about
Shopzilla's practices so that you can make informed decisions. By accepting the User Agreement, using the
Shopzilla Network, shopping at participating merchants, or otherwise interacting with Shopzilla, you are
consenting to the Shopzilla practices, including the use and disclosure of any personally identifiable
information you have shared with us, as described in this Privacy Policy.
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN

Shopzilla is not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although participating merchants on our
Web site may offer children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you should use Shopzilla
only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any personally identifiable
information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child
under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
ANTI-SPAM POLICY

Shopzilla is 100% opposed to unsolicited commercial email ("spam"). We do not send emails to anyone without
permission and we do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party. If you receive any
unsolicited emails from spammers, please be assured that Shopzilla did not provide your email address to such
parties.
This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. Unfortunately, spammers obtain
email addresses in a number of devious ways, including when you respond and ask to be taken off a spam email
list, and in some cases by just generating emails to millions of random email addresses in the hopes of
getting a few "live" ones. Please be assured that at Shopzilla we hate spam as much as you do.
All that said, if you believe that you have gotten unsolicited email from us,

to contact us and we will investigate. Please be assured that we strive not to contact
anyone without permission, and if you prefer not to receive any further communications from us, just
tell us and we'll try to make sure you never hear from us again.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES Shopzilla GATHER?

The information we learn from shoppers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at
Shopzilla and our participating merchants. Here are the general types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us

We receive and store any information you provide to us when you become a Shopzilla Member, submit a review or
survey, communicate by email, telephone or physical mail with our customer service, or otherwise interact with
us. Such information may include your name, address, email address, shopping interests and preferences, birthday,
hometown, transaction history, and other personal data.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but
then you might not be able to take advantage of certain useful Shopzilla features.

Information Gathered Automatically

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web
sites, we use "cookies" and "clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses
Shopzilla and our participating merchants' sites.

Briefly, "cookies" are small files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or your Web browser memory to
enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you, such as
recognizing you as a Shopzilla member. "Clear gifs" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of Web users or to let us know if you have
opened an email that we sent you.

Examples of the information we collect and analyze in this manner include the Internet protocol (IP) address used
to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version,
operating system, and platform; your behavior on our Web site and related Services, including the products and
merchants you view or searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on our
site or not); cookie number; and participating merchants you visit. The cookies and clear gifs that we use do
not contain and are not tied to personally identifiable information about you.

You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits although in that case you may not be able to
use certain features on our Web site.

Learn how to decline cookies
.

Third Party Advertising

We work with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies and
clear gifs to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Web site and other sites. This
information may be used to provide you with better shopping or savings opportunities through advertisements on
this and other Web sites that you visit, or to conduct market research and website analysis. In addition, these
third party advertising companies may use web beacons to help manage and optimize our online advertising.  Web
beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie, and to learn which banner ads bring users to our web site.
To opt out of this third party advertising tracking, please 
click here.
DOES SHOPZILLA SHARE THE INFORMATION IT GATHERS?

Information about Shopzilla shoppers and other users is an important part of our business, and we take steps to
maintain the privacy and security of such information against unauthorized access. We generally use such
information for such purposes as customizing future shopping and savings opportunities for you, improving our
Services, and communicating with you if you have authorized such communication. In an effort to serve you better
and improve your online shopping experiences, we may also share such information in a responsible manner as
described below.

Aggregated Research Data

The information collected from online surveys and reviews is used to develop ratings of, and research for,
participating merchants, as well as product reviews and ratings. Our research team produces research reports
and other information and data about online shopping for participating merchants and other customers, as well
as media and other interested parties. Such information and data is based upon aggregated, anonymous information
about millions of online shoppers and does not include personally identifiable information about individuals.

Agents

From time to time, we employ other companies and individuals to perform various functions on our behalf. Examples
include sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing shopper data, and providing other data and services. In such
instances, they may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will be prohibited
from using it for other purposes. We may at various times also use a web measurement service, which may employ
"cookies" and/or software code embedded in our web pages in order to evaluate key website metrics. Any such web
measurement service does not collect any personally identifiable information about our visitors unless they
voluntarily provide it, and is prohibited from using any such information except to assist us in evaluating
user behavior relating to our Web site.

Special Offers

Sometimes we may send email newsletters or special offers to selected groups of Shopzilla shoppers who have chosen
to receive email on behalf of participating merchants or other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that
merchant or business your name or e-mail address.
If you no longer wish to receive these newsletters or special offers, you can opt-out by notifying us by

clicking here

or by mail at the address below.
Business Transactions

As we continue to develop our business, we may share information with affiliates and participate in corporate
transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and it is possible that another company may acquire Shopzilla or
its business assets in the future. In such cases, user information may be shared with the acquirer and/or other
reputable parties involved in those transactions. Users will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our
Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information in such a
transaction. We provide you with 30 days notice to allow you the opportunity to notify Shopzilla if you do not
wish such information to be shared by notifying us by

clicking here
.
Protection of Shopzilla and Others

We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law;
enforce or apply our User Agreement and other agreements; assist in fraud protection or investigation; or protect
the rights, property, or security of Shopzilla, our users, or others.
With Your Consent

Other than as described above, with your consent at the time you submit information to us, we may also share your
information with participating merchants where you have shopped from time to time or their agents or other
specified parties. Once we share information with your consent with a merchant or other party, the use and
protection of that information by the merchant or other party will be subject to the privacy policies or terms of use of that
party. You may opt-out of such sharing of your information by declining to provide it or by sending a subsequent
opt-out request to us by

clicking here

or by mail at the address below; however, opting-out may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service.
PARTICIPATING MERCHANT POLICIES

Online merchants and others who participate in our Web site and other Services are encouraged to participate in
industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do
not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants and other third parties, we
cannot be responsible for their actions. We recommend that you always review the privacy policies and terms of use of merchants
and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.
JOINT SERVICES

In certain areas or features on our Web site or other Services, we may work with a reputable third-party source
of specialized information or other content and services to provide you with some information or service ("joint
services"). You authorize us to share with such party any information you provide in connection with your use of
those joint services, and such party's handling and use of any shared information shall be governed by their own
privacy policies and terms of use. You may opt-out of such sharing of your information by declining to provide it or by sending a
subsequent opt-out request to us by

click here

or by mail at the address below; however, opting-out may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service.
We recommend that you always review the privacy policies and terms of use before you complete any transaction with
the provider of any service.
HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
software, which encrypts information you input. We also use a secure server hosting location, firewall protection,
controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data. While no system is completely foolproof, we
take the security of your personal information very seriously, and our security measures are designed to protect
that information in a responsible manner.
WHAT INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?

If you register as a Shopzilla member, Shopzilla gives you access to your registration information for the
purpose of viewing and updating that information. You are also entitled to request a copy of any other personal
information we hold about you. We may charge a fee for complying with this request. If you become aware that
the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we amend it.
WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although that might prevent us from
personalizing our Services for you or prevent you from taking advantage of certain useful Shopzilla features.
If you have registered as a member, you can add or update your registration information (for instance, if your
name, email address or zip code changes), or delete your membership account entirely, at any time by visiting
the Your Accountxt

Q:
Why is this store not yet rated?
A:
Store ratings are provided by BizRate.
Not Yet Rated means that BizRate is in the process of evaluating the store but has not yet collected enough customer reviews to issue a rating. BizRate requires a minimum of 20 surveys in the past 90 days to ensure a statistically significant rating of a store's performance and not the opinion of just a handful of customers.
As soon as enough valid reviews have been collected, a rating will be calculated and displayed.

How should I use the ratings?
The Smiley Scale, combined with price information, can quickly help you find stores with the level of service quality you like for the price that you want.  For instance, if youâre interested in saving money and are not in a hurry to receive your item, then you may choose a store with a lower price, even though it doesnât have the best On-Time Delivery rating. Whereas, if you are in a hurry to receive your item, you may be willing to spend a little more at a store with an excellent On-Time Delivery rating. The Smiley Scale allows you to choose a store based on whatâs important to you.

What does the "BizRate UK Certified" seal mean?
A BizRate UK Certified store has a proven track record of dependability and customer satisfaction. To become BizRate UK Certified, a store must allow BizRate UK to place an invitation on its customersâ receipt page asking them to rate their purchase experience. BizRate UK then follows that rating up with an email to the customer making sure the goods were delivered satisfactorily and on time. If the store meets the following criteria from these surveys, the store will receive the BizRate UK Certified seal.

Must continuously solicit feedback directly from customers via the BizRate UK survey. The
store must participate in BizRate UKâs free customer survey program, allowing BizRate UK to
collect feedback continuously and directly from its customers as they check out and after
the date of fulfillment through follow-up e-mail surveys. This way, BizRate UK collects
detailed, timely feedback from real verified customers at check-out and after fulfillment
and can be sure that all customers are allowed to rate their experience.
Must maintain store ratings of Satisfactory or better on all quality dimensions of
service.
Must have received at least 20 customer surveys in the last 90 days.
Stores cannot buy the BizRate UK Certified seal.
Back to top
What does "Not Yet Rated" mean?
"Not Yet Rated" means that BizRate UK is in the process of evaluating the store but has not yet collected enough customer reviews to issue a rating. BizRate UK requires a minimum of 20 surveys in the past 90 days to ensure a statistically significant rating of a storeâs performance and not the opinion of just a handful of customers.
As soon as enough valid reviews have been collected, a rating will be calculated and displayed.
Back to top
What does "Being Re-Rated" mean?
Stores can be re-rated for a variety of reasons, including:

BizRate UK has detected a significant amount of suspicious reviews or other unusual activities
that make the prior ratings appear unreliable.
The storeâs site or operations have undergone significant changes. 
Once enough valid reviews have been gathered, a new rating will be calculated and displayed for this store.
Back to top
What is the number of reviews?
The number of reviews is the lifetime number of individual consumer reviews that BizRate UK has collected for a particular store. BizRate UK does not consider anything less than 20 reviews in a 3-month period to be a statistically relevant number and therefore does not post scores for stores below this threshold of reviews. These stores are clearly designated as: "Not Yet Rated".
Back to top
How are BizRate UKâs reviews and ratings gathered?
BizRate UK combines consumer feedback from two different sources to create the most comprehensive and reliable store ratings available anywhere.
BizRate UK Certified Ratings

Many stores are designated as "BizRate UK Certified". These stores have agreed to allow
BizRate UK to collect feedback directly from their customers as they make purchases. To do
this, BizRate UK literally sits at the receipt page of tens of millions of transactions each
month and invites real customers to share their experiences and give feedback immediately
after a purchase. Of course, a transaction is not complete
until a customer receives his or her goods, so a follow up e-mail is sent to make sure that
the store delivered the goods as promised. This continuous process ensures that BizRate UK is able
to collect timely, detailed and accurate feedback about both the ordering and fulfillment
process of every BizRate UK Certified store. No other ratings system comes close! 
BizRate UK Members Ratings

But isnât it important to have ratings for every store, not just the ones that participate
in the BizRate UK Certification program? Yes! Thatâs why BizRate UK has put together a panel of active online shoppers who have volunteered to provide store ratings and
reviews. Their reviews, combined with the reviews written by visitors to the BizRate UK website allow BizRate UK to have reliable and up-to-date ratings for stores who
donât participate in the BizRate UK Certification program. 
Back to top
How can I rate an online store?
Click on any store's Smiley Scale ratings or "read reviews" link and you will have an opportunity to "Write a Review at BizRate UK" regarding your purchases at the store.
Alternatively, every time you make a purchase at an online store look for the BizRate UK survey invitation on the receipt page. Simply click on that invitation and youâll be presented with  the BizRate UK survey. In it, youâll be asked to evaluate the store for the purchase you just made. If you do not see a survey invitation on a storeâs receipt page, it means that the store is not yet participating in BizRate UKâs free BizRate UK Certification survey program. BizRate UK encourages you to ask the store to join the program and help all online shoppers make more informed, confident decisions.
Back to top
Where can I see a storeâs ratings and read its reviews?
Anywhere that a store is listed on BizRate UK, you can click on its Smiley Scale rating or on its "read reviews" link and you will be taken to its Customer Reviews page. To search directly for any storeâs reviews, click on the Store Ratings link on the BizRate UK homepage. From there, you can search for an individual store or compare between stores in each category.
Back to top
How are BizRate UKâs ratings calculated?
BizRate UK takes great care to ensure the most rigorous, reliable and up-to-date ratings possible. Accordingly, BizRate UK takes the latest feedback from its point-of-sale survey network and combines it with the latest feedback from BizRate UK Members to arrive at Store Ratings.
The equation that determines each storeâs rating is calculated as follows for each dimension of service:
(Average Survey Scores * Number of Surveys) + (Average Member Scores * Number of Member Reviews) / (Number of Surveys + Number of Member Reviews)
Of course, since store ratings often change over time  â Holiday season is not the same as summertime, for instance â time is also a very important element in BizRate UKâs calculations. BizRate UK  only uses data from the latest 90 days when performing the calculations to arrive at a rating. That means that the store ratings on BizRate UK are never more than three months old!
It should be noted, that while each individual feedback point for all sources is weighed equally in BizRate UKâs ratings, the stores participating in the BizRate UK Certification program generally have the most reliable ratings because they allow BizRate UK to solicit feedback from actual customers immediately after a transaction and through follow-up e-mail surveys after fulfillment, when the experience with a store is freshest. Thus, the BizRate UK Certification program truly represents the "gold standard" of customer satisfaction ratings of stores. To find stores in this program look for the "BizRate UK Certified" medal on their site or on BizRate UK.

What are the quality ratings and what do they mean?
Eight of the fifteen quality ratings are determined at the point-of-sale or "checkout". These are collected by asking a storeâs customers to evaluate their purchase experiences immediately after completing the online transaction. The remaining 7 quality ratings are determined after the product is expected to have been delivered. Here are the explanations of each rating:

Q:
Why is this store not yet rated?
A:
Store ratings are provided by BizRate.
Not Yet Rated means that BizRate is in the process of evaluating the store but has not yet collected enough customer reviews to issue a rating. BizRate requires a minimum of 20 surveys in the past 90 days to ensure a statistically significant rating of a store's performance and not the opinion of just a handful of customers.
As soon as enough valid reviews have been collected, a rating will be calculated and displayed.
